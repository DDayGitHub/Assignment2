 <p>Ideal Job:Daniel Day</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <a href=http://www.seek.com.au/job/38580775?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=0f2e4cf0-2073-4b90-8c53-6f363e431015><img src="Images/job.jpg" width=275 height=300></a>
  

    <p>I think an ideal job would be one to start my career off while still learning and just breaking into the IT job scene, 
	    this job require low end troubleshooting and technical support, I should have learned this content by the time
	    i am finishing my bachelors and starting to look for jobs, I think it would be a good starting point to learn 
	    more and have time to explore other IT intrests.</p>

<p>Ideal Job:Andrei Josh Arabit</p>
    

    <p>A Computer Technician’s role in a company is to ensure all computing hardware and programs have no issues and are running
	    smoothly on a daily basis, followed by setting up computing equipment in new buildings and workplaces.

What makes this job appealing to me is that it is both a hands-on and theoretical job in the I.T department. I also enjoy building
	    and setting up computers with also finding the solution to problems in a computer internally or externally for it to be
	    repaired. 

The typical skills of becoming a computer technician can be found and learned off internet sites such as; Youtube. Many tutorials 
	    for all skill segments and problem fixes can be watched and applied to gain skill and experience. There are qualifications 
	    for this job, however having a strong knowledge on information technology and computer systems is highly encouraged to
	    make the job less stressful in times. 

With skills learnt from previous classes of information technology, I have found an interest in wanting to learn more about computer
	    technology and I.T. By building my own personal computer and encountering errors, I have learnt that building and setting
	    up a PC can be difficult without having a general knowledge and watching tutorial’s. 

I plan to obtain more skills towards this job as I am currently undertaking this course (Bachelor of Information Technology) to
	    ensure I have gained more knowledge and experiences prior to working within the IT sector of the workforce. There is so 
	    much to know about IT which is great as there are many categories which fall into IT, computing and system hardware.

</p>
	
	  <p>Ideal Job:Callum Movric</p>
    
    <p>My ideal Job is a software engineer/developer. I have a lot of different career paths I am interested in,
	    but all of them revolve around being a software engineer or developer. I have a dream career in video game development,
	    specifically creating my own engine. I would love to create a team of like minded people working towards the same goal, 
	    creating a story and world full of exploration. I would be working with pre-built software (commonly know as "engines") 
	    using C/C++ and API's making sure that idea's and concepts transition into the game smoothly.
