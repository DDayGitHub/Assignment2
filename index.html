I am 22 years old and I am from South East Melbourne. I was born in Melbourne; however, my parents are from the middle east,
I’m am married to a beautiful Spanish woman. So naturally I speak English, Arabic and Spanish! For work, I am a sales manager of a high performing retail telecommunications
environment with Monash University. I started in telecommunications and now I have worked my up.
My work is where my interest for I.T. has come from. Which is why I decided to go back to study my first degree. I am a very
boring person. Although but my friends say I’m the happiest man alive. Along with, an interesting fact about myself is that I
love to Barbeque food (low ‘n slow over minimum 8 hours). I do love dogs more than anything, but I’m having a little trouble
convincing my wife to let me buy one.

I'm from Melbourne, Australia. My email is s3663902@student.rmit.edu.au, I am a Full-time student and a  Part-time worker
I Enjoy music and gaming, Interesting fact: I drive a manual transmission vehicle :).
</p>
<p>
My interest in Information Technology is that it is a broad subject containing many topics that can be learnt to adapt different
skills and experiences. Information Technology isn’t only about “computers” or “networking” it is also about learning and
identifying problems internally or externally in order to maintain information systems error free. 

In years 9 to 11 in secondary school I chose to study I.T. In which I gained basic knowledge on information technology 
followed by developing websites as an assignment. 

I have had a long interest in I.T however coming out of high school I chose to take a path to have a future career in the Business
sector. 4 years have now past and I have decided to re-route into I.T hoping it will give me new knowledge and skills in thefuture. 

Being a student in RMIT currently, I did not have to change Universities making it an easy process to enrol into this course.
I chose to stay with RMIT as throughout my years of being an undergraduate I have had a positive experience with the overall 
environment, students, lecturers and tutors. Based at the Melbourne CBD campus, it was an easy route to get to from home, also with 
it being based in one of the main streets of Melbourne. 

While studying I.T, I’d like to gain and acquire knowledge in how to program and develop websites which require coding at an intermediate
level. Being able to identify syntax problems and correcting it in minimal time ensuring all codes run well. I would have hope to also
learn the fundamentals of Information Technology and its topics, gaining a general insight for what could potentially be applied when
in the IT sector of the workforce.

	<p>After taking the Educationplanner.org "Whats your Learning Style?" test. I found out that I am mainly a auditory learner. 
		I find this very interesting because I took a similar test to this in grade 7 which is roughly 6 years ago. 
		The results I got from that test was that I was a visual learner more than anything else.
		<br>
		-Auditory: 40%
		<br>
		-Visual: 35%
		<br>
		-Tactile: 25%
		<br>
		    Campainer ENFP-T is what I got after completing the personality test from 16personalities.com.
		    I found the test to be very accurate in that I am Extroverted (67% percent to be exact).
		    The results continue to speak truths about how interact with my colleagues. 
		    The article explains that I view colleagues as friends, people who I show genuine interest in and care for. 
		    I find this so accurate as I enjoy spending time with people at work.

    <p>The results on the test’s to me were no surprise, as the 16 personalities test shows I am introvert which is 100% accurate,
	    as this is no shock to me INTP like to work alone or in small groups, but they can be very hands on and extremely open minded but blunt as the same-time.
After doing these test’s I believe I like to be challenged, We are often drawn to people who engage in intellectual conversations and always looking to push
	    our selves to be best we can be, we are also extremely independent and we best work in small groups.
With that in mind I would look for groups that are small and intellectual a little more on the shy/quiet side as this is what
	    is what is best suited for an INTP as work like to be independent and keep to our own.</p>

    <p>I think an ideal job would be one to start my career off while still learning and just breaking into the IT job scene, 
	    this job require low end troubleshooting and technical support, I should have learned this content by the time
	    i am finishing my bachelors and starting to look for jobs, I think it would be a good starting point to learn 
	    more and have time to explore other IT intrests.</p>

<b class="fff">Ideal Job: Andrei Josh Arabit</b>
<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>A Computer Technician’s role in a company is to ensure all computing hardware and programs have no issues and are running
	    smoothly on a daily basis, followed by setting up computing equipment in new buildings and workplaces.

What makes this job appealing to me is that it is both a hands-on and theoretical job in the I.T department. I also enjoy building
	    and setting up computers with also finding the solution to problems in a computer internally or externally for it to be
	    repaired. 

The typical skills of becoming a computer technician can be found and learned off internet sites such as; Youtube. Many tutorials 
	    for all skill segments and problem fixes can be watched and applied to gain skill and experience. There are qualifications 
	    for this job, however having a strong knowledge on information technology and computer systems is highly encouraged to
	    make the job less stressful in times. 

With skills learnt from previous classes of information technology, I have found an interest in wanting to learn more about computer
	    technology and I.T. By building my own personal computer and encountering errors, I have learnt that building and setting
	    up a PC can be difficult without having a general knowledge and watching tutorial’s. 

I plan to obtain more skills towards this job as I am currently undertaking this course (Bachelor of Information Technology) to
	    ensure I have gained more knowledge and experiences prior to working within the IT sector of the workforce. There is so 
	    much to know about IT which is great as there are many categories which fall into IT, computing and system hardware.

 <p>My ideal Job is a software engineer/developer. I have a lot of different career paths I am interested in,
	    but all of them revolve around being a software engineer or developer. I have a dream career in video game development,
	    specifically creating my own engine. I would love to create a team of like minded people working towards the same goal, 
	    creating a story and world full of exploration. I would be working with pre-built software (commonly know as "engines") 
	    using C/C++ and API's making sure that idea's and concepts transition into the game smoothly.

 <p>IThis would be my ideal job as it has a wide range of of IT aspects and greatly suites the career I wish to be in.
As I wish to be software developer this job seems to be extremely satisfying as there are many different aspects from HTML
and CSS to building applications and the design and the infrastructure for project’s.
To gain such a position it would require a number of years within the IT sector, along with a Qualification in IT, and web
development and database knowledge, reviewing and testing source code and Develop report testing for applications that have be requested.
As of current I have no qualifications in this current field, hence under-taking Uni at RMIT so that I am able to obtain the 
 knowledge that can lead my into the job I wish to see myself in.
To obtain these skills it will take 3 - 5 years of not only Uni but self learning and teaching as IT is always evolving this are 
changing on a daily basis. It may also require for teaching for more in-depth skills such as more advanced coding and database infrastructure.
